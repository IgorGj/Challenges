With challenge 01 and challenge 03 i did git clone, there i did a mistake because on those two branches i have a folder ("brainsterchallenges ...."), and now i don't know how to delete those branches. On challenge-04 i openned the folder where i had already finished the challenge and there i initialized git, than added remote origin and after that i made a new branch called challenge-04, added my project, commited the same and pushed it remotely, and i am doing the same with this file.
Deleted the unncessary folders in challenge-01 and challenge-03 and renaming challenge-06 in challenge-06-git-and-gitlab
